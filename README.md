# WVR-Glove-Configurator

## Description
To configure the glove I've wrote this application to simplify things.<br/>
The executable can be found under bin>Debug>WVR Glove Configurator.exe<br/>

## Usage
After the configuration simply upload the settings to your desire Serial COM Port.<br/>
Settings should be automatically applied, but if you don't see any changes just reboot/reset the Esp32 via the reboot/reset button.

> **note!** On some Esp32-dev boards the **boot button** must be pressed during the uploading process.
